# Twitter.Filter
## UniSocial/Community Score
One of the Problems with Twitter: is people are extremely Impulsive, spread nonsense, and very abrasive! Solution: Filter out All Individuals you don't know! Only see "Organizations" who are often more careful about posting, &amp; "Verified" Individuals who have a high (unisocial.net/)Community-Score for character traits you care about!


## Verified identities only
Only see Verified users, thus Reducing the amount bad faith caused by people "Hiding behing Anonymity"!
